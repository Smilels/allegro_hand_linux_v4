# C++ API(Grasp Demo)

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to run the motion demo for the Allegro Hand V4 using **C++ API**. Note that this API does not need ROS.

Make sure that you are following well with [**Setup** in README.md](../README.md#setup).

## File Structure

## Build the `grasp` Program

We use an **out-of-source** build style to keep source files clean.

1. **Configure the Allegro Hand V4**

- Before building the grasping program, ensure that the hand configuration in [`main.cpp`](./grasp/main.cpp) matches your hardware settings.:
  ```cpp
  // USER HAND CONFIGURATION
  const bool RIGHT_HAND = true;
  const int HAND_VERSION = 4;
  const double tau_cov_const_v4 = 1200.0; // 1200.0 for SAH040xxxxx
  ```

2. **Build with CMake**

    ```bash
    cd grasp
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install
    ```

   - The `build/` directory contains all compiled files. If needed, you can delete it and rebuild without affecting the source code.

3. **Run the Motion Demo**

   - Power on the Allegro Hand V4 and **Connect PCAN-USB

   - Start the Grasping Program

     ```bash
     cd grasp/build/bin
     ./grasp
     ```

   - Use Keyboard Commands to Control the Hand

     | Command | Action |
     |---------|--------|
     | `H` | Home Position (PD control) |
     | `R` | Ready Position (used before grasping) |
     | `G` | Three-Finger Grasp |
     | `K` | Four-Finger Grasp |
     | `P` | Two-finger pinch (index-thumb) |
     | `M` | Two-finger pinch (middle-thumb) |
     | `E` | Envelop Grasp (all fingers) |
     | `A` | Gravity Compensation |
     | `F` | Turn Servos OFF (any grasp command turns them back on) |
     | `1` | Rock Motion (from `RockScissorsPaper.cpp`) |
     | `2` | Scissors Motion (from `RockScissorsPaper.cpp`) |
     | `3` | Paper Motion (from `RockScissorsPaper.cpp`) |
     | `Q` | Quit program |

---

## Notes

- If the hand does not move, double-check the **PCAN interface** and **Configuration of the Allegro Hand V4**.
- If you need custom grasping motions, modify `RockScissorsPaper.cpp`.

### ðŸŽ¯ You're all set! Now you can experiment with different grasping techniques and develop new motion strategies! ðŸš€
